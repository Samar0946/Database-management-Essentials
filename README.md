# Database-management-Essentials
This is my assignments I've solved in the database management essentials which consider Part of Data Warehousing for Business Intelligence Specialization 
I'm gonna upload all cases I had worked on during this course from the simplest to the most complex one
This course mainly depend on the PL-SQL and using Oracle database. 
Course have eleven modules, but I'm gonna start with the third one because the first and the second depend on theratical staff.
Module three focus mainly on the PL-SQL statments. 
I used CREATE and INSERT statments to create my university database and insert values in it using PL-SQL statments
Module four focus on complex PL-SQL statments using JOINS, ORDERBY, and other complex statments.
