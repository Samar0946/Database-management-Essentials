# Database-management-Essentials
This is my assignments I've solved in the database management essentials which consider Part of Data Warehousing for Business Intelligence Specialization 
I'm gonna upload all cases I had worked on during this course from the simplest to the most complex one
Excited to announce that I had finished database management essentials course with grade 97.45%, but the challenge just began because this is a part of 5 courses. 

This course mainly depend on the PL-SQL and using Oracle database which have eleven modules, but I'm gonna start with the third one because the first and the second depend on theoretical staff.

Module three focus mainly on the PL-SQl statements. 

I used CREATE and INSERT statements to create my university database and insert values in it using PL-SQL statements.

Module four focus on complex PL-SQL statements using JOINS, ORDERBY, and other complex statements. 

Module five focus on how to use and set the operators in PL-SQL and modification statements.



Starting from week four (module six) the instructor start to focus on Database development, basic ERD notation, and Relationship variations and we used Visual paradigm to build our ERDs.

Module seven is about Basic mapping rules and problems face us during it and ER Assistant Demonstration.

module eight demonstrate info about Conceptual data modeling goals and challenges, Analyzing narrative problems, and Design transformations.

module nine extends the info about data modeling problems and how to solve it beside how to finalize the ERDs.



module ten describe Goals and steps of logical database design, Conversion rules, and Conversion problems.

module eleven and the last module extents the knowledge to the Modification anomalies, how to deal with Functional dependencies.

Beside the normalization steps and normalization problems.
